# BTRandomMechComponentUpgrader

Mod that allows to upgrade and add random mech components (weapons/heatsinks...) based on configurable lists applied on a per faction basis.  
Basic configs for Vanilla and BTX exist. There is also an optional download with worse than average (-) weapons for BTX, made by RJPhoenix.  

The mod should only allow changes to a mech that a player could also do in the argos mechlab.  
Every generated mech gets checked by the same code that checks a players mech, and if errors get found it gets rejected and the base variant will be used instread.
These checks include over/underweight, hardpoints and inventiry slots. But not something like ballistics TTS on a full energy mech.
