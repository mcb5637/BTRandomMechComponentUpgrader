  ListLink rerolls the upgrade, possibly upgrading it furher, but this item gets ignored when calculating the upgrade start point.
  AllowDowngrade allows lower items (and itself) to be selected, downgrading equipment (global or as per component) (i recommend only putting it on the base component, so something like The Raids custom mechs dont get downgraded).**/
