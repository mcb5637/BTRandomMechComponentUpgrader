  MinDate requires a date to be passed, if not passed next item gets selected.
  ListLink rerolls the upgrade, possibly upgrading it furher, but this item gets ignored when calculating the upgrade start point.
  UpgradeAll upgrades all copies to this variant (ignores if already other upgraded).
  SwapAmmoFrom changes ammo types to SwapAmmoTo (in conjunction with UpgradeAll used to change to different ammo weapons).
  AllowDowngrade allows lower items (and itself) to be selected, downgrading equipment (global or as per component) (i recommend only putting it on the base component, so something like The Raids custom mechs dont get downgraded).**/
